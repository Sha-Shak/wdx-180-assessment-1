## Basics of Computing

### What is an operating system, and what are its primary responsibilities in managing computer hardware and software?

An operating system is software that manages the software and hardware resources  for a system. It acts as an interface between the computer hardware and software.

## HTML

### Describe the structure of an HTML document. What is the purpose of the `<head>` and `<body>` sections?

An HTML document defines the semantic structure of a web page. The head contains information about the page that is meant for the browser and is not visible on the actual website. The body contains the information that will be visible to a user that is interacting with the website.

### Differentiate between block-level and inline-level elements in HTML. Provide at least two examples of each.

Block level elements start from a new line and take up the full width available whereas inline elements do not start from a new line and take up only as much width as necessary.

## CSS

### Explain the differences between inline, internal, and external CSS. When is each method most appropriate?

Provide your answer here.

Inline CSS is for adding styles to specific elements, whereas internal CSS defines a style for an entire HTML document. External CSS are styles defined in an external document. 

### Discuss the box model in CSS. How do content, padding, border, and margin define the size and space of an element?

The box model describes the design and layout of elements. The content is the actual content of the element (e.g. text and images), the padding is an area around the content and the border. The margin is an area otyside the border. 

## JavaScript

### Explain the concept of variables in JavaScript. Compare `var`, `let`, and `const` with examples.

Variables are like containers that store information, such as numbers and strings. Var is an older way to define a variable in JS. It allows you to deifne a variable with the same name as another variable, whereas let and const do not. Let and const are newer ways to define variables introduced in ES6. Const does not allow you to change the value of a variable once assigned, whereas let allows the reassignment of a variable. 

### What is a closure in JavaScript, and how is it used?

Provide your answer here.

A closure is when a function remembers its variables even after it has executed. Closures can be used when we want to keep track of values, such as a count variable which increases with every step.

## Tools and Workflow

### What are the key stages of the Git workflow? Explain the terms working directory, staging area, and commit.

Provide your answer here.

### Why are Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and code editors essential in web development? Provide examples of popular tools and their features.

IDEs such as VS Code are important because they provide a platform to write, compile, test and debug code. It makes the process of coding easier and more efficient 

### Complete each question by providing concise, accurate, and relevant answers. Use examples or code snippets when appropriate for better clarity.
